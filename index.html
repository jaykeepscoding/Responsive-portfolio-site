                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Hailing from Ghana, West Africa, my journey into the world of computer science began early in my childhood. 
                    Growing up, my fascination with technology only deepened as I progressed through school. It was during my 
                    formative years that I discovered HBO's Silicon Valley—a show that ignited a passion for computer science 
                    and programming unlike anything I had experienced before. Silicon Valley became more than just a TV series; 
                    it became a source of inspiration, fueling my desire to pursue a career in technology. 
                    However, this dream meant leaving behind everything familiar to me and embarking on a new chapter in the United States.
                    The decision to pursue computer science abroad was not without its challenges. Yet, with unwavering determination and resilience, 
                    I navigated through obstacles and emerged stronger than ever. 
                    Today, I stand proud as a Software Developer, ready to contribute my skills and experiences to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My life outside my career involves fashion - a sneakerhead I might add, photography, playing video games (mostly FIFA), and hangin out with family & friends.<br>
                </p>
