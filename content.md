├── ABOUT
    ├── BIO
        Hailing from Ghana, West Africa, my journey into the world of computer science began early in my childhood. 
        Growing up, my fascination with technology only deepened as I progressed through school. It was during my 
        formative years that I discovered HBO's Silicon Valley—a show that ignited a passion for computer science 
        and programming unlike anything I had experienced before. Silicon Valley became more than just a TV series; 
        it became a source of inspiration, fueling my desire to pursue a career in technology. 
        However, this dream meant leaving behind everything familiar to me and embarking on a new chapter in the United States.
        The decision to pursue computer science abroad was not without its challenges. Yet, with unwavering determination and resilience, 
        I navigated through obstacles and emerged stronger than ever. 
        Today, I stand proud as a Software Developer, ready to contribute my skills and experiences to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
        My life outside my career involves fashion - a sneakerhead I might add, photography, playing video games (mostly FIFA), and hangin out with family & friends.
